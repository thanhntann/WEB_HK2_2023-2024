    <p> <img src="img/smile.png" alt="smile1" align=bottom>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of
        the mouth. It is believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a 
        contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne 
        smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
